Installation procedure for weirdbird cms:

If you encounter problems, please have a look at the project page
https://github.com/thomas-lack/weirdbird-cms

1) Prepare your database by executing the SQL statement provided in
the file 'weirdbird-database-schema.sql' in your weirdbird cms
'INSTALL' folder.

2) Edit the file 'application/config/database.php', using the connect
data provided by your website host. At least you will want to edit
the fields for 'database', 'username' and 'password'.

3) If you are using a subfolder on your webspace, you will want to
edit the '.htaccess' file, so that the URL rewriting is pointing
to the correct subfolder path.

4) If you moved the template folder or the user-upload folder or just
want to change the error reporting level go to the 'index.php' file in
the main folder. Edit the settings to your needs.

5) For custom templates you will have to copy them into the
'site-templates' folder.

6) Make sure you have writing rights for the php system user on the
'user-upload' folder.

6) After all this is set up, navigate to 'http://your-domain/cms'.
Use the name 'Administrator' and the password 'adminadmin' to access
the cms.

7) Go to the 'User' tab and change at least the password of the
Administrator user.

8) Go to the templates tab and import all available site templates.
Afterwards chose one and set it to active.

9) Now the site should be usable. You can start defining your site
structure and adding articles.



Have a lot of fun with weirdbird cms!
